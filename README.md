# COP-3710-Smart-Home-IoT-Sensor-Analytics-Database
Project by Savitri Harkhu

Designing an IoT database storing sensor readings and weather data. It will include anomaly detection queries and retention-based partitioning. The main focus scope of the domain will be on the weather and temperature data collected by the smart home systems that people have in their houses and buildings over the course of minutes, days and a year. This project's end goal is to successfully organize these datasets and be able to relate the large-scale domain through modeling & using a relational schema design.

Database Application: OracleSQL via DataGrip. Using DataGrip will allow for efficient creation of different tables and schemas/users at once, in comparison to the ui of the OracleSQL, where the user writes one line at a time. I will be selecting the database of Oracle to make it function. This application provides the user with queries that they can type in, with their results displayed in the command window.
