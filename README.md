# COP-3710-Smart-Home-IoT-Sensor-Analytics-Database
Project by Savitri Harkhu

Designing an IoT database storing sensor readings and weather data. It will include anomaly detection queries and retention-based partitioning. The main focus scope of the domain will be on the weather and temperature data collected by the smart home systems that people have in their houses and buildings over the course of minutes, days and a year. This project's end goal is to successfully organize these datasets and be able to relate the large-scale domain through modeling & using a relational schema design.
